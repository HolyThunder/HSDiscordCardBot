####Settting it up

All you need to do to set it up is unpack the .zip, which contains a *ChatBot.jar* file inside and a *settings.json* file. The *settings.json* should look like this

>{
  "BotAccountEmail": "YOURBOTACCOUNTEMAIL",
  "BotAccountUsername": "YOURBOTACCOUNTUSERNAME",
  "BotAccountPassword": "YOURBOTACCOUNTPASSWORD"
}

All you need to do is replace *YOURBOTACCOUNTEMAIL*, *YOURBOTACCOUNTUSERNAME* and *YOURBOTACCOUNTPASSWORD* with your actual bot account information. The bot needs to be in your server, so be sure to log into it's account and click your server's invite link.
#### Running it

After everything is set up (really hard, huh) all you gotta do is run the .jar file. Whether you're on windows or linux (or even mac I think) all you have to do is open a terminal, navigate to the location of the *HSChatBot.jar* and *settings.json* and type
>java -jar HSChatBot.jar

And you're good to go! Remember to customize your bot by loging into it's account and changing it's avatar!
